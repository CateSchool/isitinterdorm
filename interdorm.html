            <h1>Interdorm (non-resident) Room Visiting </h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Interdorm visiting involves non-residents visiting individual resident rooms within a given dorm.
                Non-resident visitation within personal rooms will commence after each dorm has had the opportunity to
                set community expectations and norms, for upper level students that is typically after Outings Week and
                for lower school students it is after Fall Family Weekend.
            </p>
            <p>Once interdorm visitation commences, the following guidelines will apply:</p>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Guest and host must ask the faculty who is on duty for permission before entering the host's room.
                </li>

                <li>There must be a faculty on duty for interdorm visitation.</li>

                <li>Doors must be fully open (like study hours condition). If on a balcony, both the room door and the
                    balcony doors must stay open.
                </li>

                <li>The guest can only go into the room of their host (must ask for permission to go into another
                    person's room).
                </li>

                <li>A resident can host more than one interdorm visitor at a time (faculty on duty is aware of this).
                </li>

                <li>Overhead light must stay on. </li>

                <li>Privacy of others in the dorm, particularly roommates, must always be respected. Behavioral
                    expectations during interdorm are the same as at other times and the School expects students to
                    refrain from sexual intimacy.</li>

                <li>Guest must be aware and follow the rules and boundaries of their host and roommate, if they have
                    one, when in their room.</li>
            </ol>
