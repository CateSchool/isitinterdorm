            <h1>Interdorm (non-resident) Room Visiting </h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Interdorm visiting involves non-residents visiting individual resident rooms within a given dorm.
                Non-resident visitation within personal rooms will commence after each dorm has had the opportunity to
                set community expectations and norms, for upper level students that is typically after Outings Week and
                for lower school students it is after Fall Family Weekend.
            </p>
            <p>Once interdorm visitation commences, the following guidelines will apply:</p>
            <p><em>For 9th graders:</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Interdorm visitation may take place on weeknights (Tues-Thurs and S Fridays) from 6pm-7:45pm; on N
                    Fridays from 6pm-10pm; on Saturdays from 4pm-6pm and 8-10pm; and on Sundays from 4pm-6pm.</li>
                <li>Guest and host must check in with the faculty on duty for permission before entering the host’s
                    room.</li>
                <li>The guest can only go into the room of their host (must ask for permission to go into another
                    person’s room). </li>
                <li>Doors need to remain open.</li>
                <li>A resident can host more than one interdorm visitor at a time.</li>
                <li>When visiting or hosting visitors, students should be aware and considerate of others with respect
                    to noise, traffic, culture and climate.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>For 10th, 11th, and 12th graders:</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Students may visit single-gender dorms of the same gender outside of the academic day.</li>
                <li>Students may visit single-gender dorms of a different gender during visiting hours on weeknights
                    (Tues-Thurs and S Fridays) from 6pm-7:45pm; on N Fridays from 6pm-10pm; on Saturdays from 4pm-6pm
                    and 8-10pm; and on Sundays from 4pm-6pm.</li>
                <li>Guest and host must check in with the faculty on duty for permission before entering the host’s
                    room.</li>
                <li>The guest can only go into the room of their host (must ask for permission to go into another
                    person’s room). </li>
                <li>Doors need to remain open.</li>
                <li>A resident can host more than one interdorm visitor at a time.</li>
                <li>When visiting or hosting visitors, students should be aware and considerate of others with respect
                    to noise, traffic, culture and climate.</li>
                <li>Residents of the all-gender dorm can host non-resident students during visiting hours following the
                    same guidelines listed above.
                </li>
